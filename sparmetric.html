The primary colours of black and dark greys set a subdued and serious tone while the yellow accent colour adds a sense of action and energy. The secondary colours are used to represent the red and blue corners found in MMA and boxing matches are used to represent their respective stats.</p>

High-level martial artists and their coaches want a way to see detailed statistics about each sparring session so that they can perfect their training and skill set. Lower level martial artists want a way to unlock achievements to help them set goals and motivate them to improve.</p>
